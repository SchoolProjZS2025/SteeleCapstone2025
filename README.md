Quick breakdown of the video series:

Intro - In progress.

Tools - Introduction to the tools used throughout the course. Not a required watch if you already have a Postman/Insomnia/SoapUI project for testing your application.

Continuous Monitoring - Covers the first section of the checklist. These items should be in the back of your mind as you continue testing the other checklist items.

Response Headers - Covers response header risks and identifying common misconfigurations.

Cookie Checks - Reviewing cookie attributes.

Code Review Resources - A high level recommendation for app teams to build out a code review document for their teams. This page is not a template or a comprehensive list of resources, just a starting point.

The next set of videos utilize the payload lists provided in this GitHub repo to dynamically test for common vulnerabilities. This includes cross-site scripting, SQL injection, directory traversal, etc.

Login Pages - Covering common vulnerabilities surrounding login functionality.

Session Management - Testing session functionality without using malicious payloads or automated tools.

Misc - Common vulnerabilities that do not fit neatly into the above categories.
